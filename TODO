Number must have +/-INFINITY flags and take care of cmp to take that into
   account (this to support infinite list).

Printer should check this flag to print accordingly.

Lexer should return a struct like this:

    struct Token {
      TokenType type;
      union {
        char *str;
        double num;
      } token;
      struct {
        int line, col
      } beg, end;
      char *source;
    }

and most of this information should be keeped at least until expansion time is
   over, maybe during runtime too to report fexpr error if the project goes
   this way

---

Check with valgrind where there are memory leak during runtime

---

Fix the problem with Environment_delete which fail when trying to delete the
   same thing two times (some stuff like symbols might appear several time
   there)

=> go for a mark-and-sweep GC ?
=> use libgc ?

libunistring ?
libffi ?
libreadline ?
libgmp ?
