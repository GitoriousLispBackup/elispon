Lexer should return a struct like this:
struct Token {
  TokenType type;
  union {
    char *str;
    double num;
  } token;
  struct {
    int line, col
  } beg, end;
  char *source;
}
and most of this information should be keeped at least until expansion time is
   over, maybe during runtime too to report fexpr error.
