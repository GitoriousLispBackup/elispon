Lexer should return a struct like this:
struct Token {
  TokenType type;
  union {
    char *str;
    double num;
  } token;
  struct {
    int line, col
  } beg, end;
  char *source;
}
and most of this information should be keeped at least until expansion time is
over, maybe during runtime too to report fexpr error if the project goes this
way

---

Printer should use Port (Port must support printf)

---

Check with valgrind where there are memory leak during runtime
