Number must have +/-INFINITY flags and take care of cmp to take that into
   account (this to support infinite list).

Printer should check this flag to print accordingly.

(define-struct foo (bar baz))
(define lala (make-foo 1 2))
(foo-bar lala) -> 1
(foo-baz lala) -> 2
(foo? lala) -> t
lala -> #<struct:foo>
(type lala) -> foo

Lexer should return a struct like this:

    struct Token {
      TokenType type;
      union {
        char *str;
        double num;
      } token;
      struct {
        int line, col
      } beg, end;
      char *source;
    }

and most of this information should be keeped at least until expansion time is
   over, maybe during runtime too to report fexpr error if the project goes
   this way

(error "message" symbol)

if error primitive have an additionnal argument, also print location info
   extracted from symbol

Fix the problem with Environment_delete which fail when trying to delete the
   same thing two times (some stuff like symbols might appear several time
   there)

=> go for a mark-and-sweep GC ?
=> use libgc ?

libunistring ?
libffi ?
libreadline ?
libgmp ?
